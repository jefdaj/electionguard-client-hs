try to translate the python unit tests into haskell using the api

re-export common stuff to deduplicate:
  ping
  Common.hs
  Configuration.hs (include a test config for localhost)
  SecuritySchemes.hs? it seems empty

re-export simpler version of guardian operations:
  createBackupChallenge
  createGuardian
  createGuardianBackup
  decryptBallotShares
  decryptShare
  generateAuxiliaryKeys
  generateElectionKeys

re-export simpler versions of mediator operations:
  verifyBackup
  verifyChallenge
  appendToTally
  buildElectionContext
  castBallot
  combineElectionKeys
  convertTrackerToWords
  decryptBallots
  decryptTally
  encryptBallots
  getElectionConstants
  spoilBallot
  startTally
  validateElectionDescription
